Experimentations in Q-Learning with C#

Based on [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2018/august/test-run-introduction-to-q-learning-using-csharp) (NOTE: as of this writing, the image of the maze is not available there, but can be found [here](https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2018/08/06/q-learning-using-c/))

The goal of this project is to explore Q-Learning, and to do so without the benefit of additional tooling, in order to better understand how it works.  Using the above article as a basis, this project creates a customizable maze which an agent will navigate through in an attempt to reach a specific goal state, allowing for multiple rewards/objectives along the path from start to goal.

I have selected C# and .Net as the language and technology in order to be able to easily incorporate Q-Learning into some existing projects.
